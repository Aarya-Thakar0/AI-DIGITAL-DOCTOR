# AI-DIGITAL-DOCTOR
This was My First hackathon Project.
**This is a fall in Lession learned catagory**, Because the program is working complitly, but after make changes in front-end the programm stop working, i try to Reslove The Problem.

## Problem : front-end data is NOT "POST" in Back-end.
__The Problem is The Data Entered in frontend is **not GET** by The Backend AI Model, or The Frontend Data is **not POST** in Backend.__
